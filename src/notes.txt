we are using bm25f algorithm because we are considering multiple fields for score claculation ie title,abstract, content

B is a parameter that controls the degree of length normalization applied to the document-term frequency component of the
    BM25F formula. Document length normalization is crucial because without it, 
    longer documents might inherently score higher simply because they contain more words.


 K1 of the BM25 scoring function is a parameter that affects how the term frequency (TF) contributes to the document's
 relevance score


 parser query object will look ike this if the user query is neural netwoks
  Query: (title:neural OR abstract:neural OR content:neural) OR (title:networks OR abstract:networks OR content:networks)
